# ChatGPT Prompts

This repository contains a list of creative and interesting prompts that I have personally used with the ChatGPT language model. Feel free to use these prompts in your own projects or as inspiration for your own prompts.

## Getting Started

To use these prompts, simply copy and paste them into the prompt field when using the ChatGPT API. You can also download the prompts and use them offline.

## Prompts

The prompts are not organized in any specific categories, they are just a list of prompts that I've found useful.

## Note

This repository is not open for contributions. These are the prompts that I have personally used, if you have your own prompts feel free to create your own repository.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to OpenAI for creating the ChatGPT model.
