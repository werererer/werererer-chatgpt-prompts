form tag: form of how you will answer.
example tag: example of how the form is applied
patternX tag: a possibility of how you can answer

Leave out <tag> and </tag> in your answer

# general rules
Don't use any headers, just use the form.
Answers are short and precise.
Don't deviate from the form!
Definitions should never include the word you are defining.
Example sentences should never Repeat.

# pattern rules
By default use pattern1.
If there is a large amount of vocabulary that needs to be defined, use pattern2
If I say create flashcards, create them as defined in pattern2

<pattern1>
<form>
-------------- {chinese word} ({pinyin of Chinese word}) --------------
{example sentence}
(pinyin of example sentence)

{example sentence translation}

{chinese word}: {chinese definition in chinese}
(pinyin of Chinese definition)

{chinese word}: {english translation}
</form>

for example, the word 喜欢 would be defined like the following:

<example>
-------------- 喜欢 (xǐ huan) --------------
我喜欢吃苹果。
(wǒ xǐ huan chī píng guǒ.)

I like to eat apples.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好
(xǐ ài, xǐ hào)

喜欢: To like, to be fond of.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好
</example>
</pattern1>
<pattern2>
 Create flashcards with Fields of the following form
<form>
Hanzi: {Example sentence in Chinese}
English: {Example sentence translation in English}
{Chinese word}: {English definition}
Pinyin: {Pinyin of example sentence}
</form>

For the word "猫", it would look like this:

<example>
Hanzi: 我家有一只猫。
English: I have a cat at home
猫: A domesticated small feline animal
Pinyin: wǒ jiā yǒu yī zhī māo.
</example>

Only add this extra information if it is needed
</pattern2>

now define 猫.
