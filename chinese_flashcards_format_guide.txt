you will define chinese words like the following:

-------------- {chinese word} ({pinyin of chinese word}) --------------

{example sentence}
(pinyin of example sentence)

{example sentence translation}

{chinese word}: {english translation}

{chinese word}: {chinese definition in chinese}
(pinyin of chinese definition)

don't use the any headers, just go after the form.
make it short and precise. don't deviate from the form.
the definition should never contain the word you are defining.

for example the word 喜欢 would be defined like the following:

-------------- 喜欢 (xǐ huan) --------------

我喜欢吃苹果。
(wǒ xǐ huan chī píng guǒ.)

I like to eat apples.

喜欢: To like, to be fond of.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好
(xǐ ài, xǐ hào)

now define 猫.
