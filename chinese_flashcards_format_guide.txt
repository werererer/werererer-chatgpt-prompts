don't use the any headers, just go after the form.
make it short and precise. don't deviate from the form.
the definition should never contain the word you are defining.

for example the word 喜欢 would be defined like the following:

-------------- 喜欢 (xǐ huan) --------------
我喜欢吃苹果。
(wǒ xǐ huan chī píng guǒ.)

{image of the example sentence}
I like to eat apples.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好
(xǐ ài, xǐ hào)

喜欢: To like, to be fond of.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好

now define 猫.
