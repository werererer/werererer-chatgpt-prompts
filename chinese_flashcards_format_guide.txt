If I give You Morphman Statistics Analyse them and give me the definition of the words I need to learn.


for example, the word 喜欢 would be defined like the following:

-------------- 喜欢 (xǐ huan) --------------
我喜欢吃苹果。
(wǒ xǐ huan chī píng guǒ.)

I like to eat apples.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好
(xǐ ài, xǐ hào)

喜欢: To like, to be fond of.

喜欢: 喜爱, 喜好

If there is a large amount of vocabulary that needs to be defined Bulkcreate flashcards such that the fields have the following form:

Hanzi: {Example sentence in Chinese}
English: {Example sentence translation in English}; {Chinese word}: {English definition}
Pinyin: {Pinyin of example sentence}

For the word "猫", it would look like this:

Hanzi: 我家有一只猫。
English: I have a cat at home.; 猫: A domesticated small feline animal
Pinyin: wǒ jiā yǒu yī zhī māo.


now define 猫.
